//! This sub-mod provides some facilities about memory performance profiling.
//! # Memory usage of current process
//! There's a platform-related function called `get_process_memory_info` available on MacOS and Windows.
//! # Memory usage of ALL Rust allocations
//! We provide a `CountingAllocator` that wraps the system allocator but tracks the bytes used by rust allocations.
//! This crate DOES NOT replace the global allocator by default. You need to make it as a `global_allocator` or enable the `allocation_counter` feature.
//! ```ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static _COUNTER: perf_monitor::mem::CountingAllocator = perf_monitor:mem::CountingAllocator;
//! ```
